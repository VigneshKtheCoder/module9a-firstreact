# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx
	
## Challenges
I had a lot of difficulties installing React and Vite in my command prompt, however I understoof how to do it after the instructions gave me the Windows' Users Command. I also had some errors getting the profile to go on the local host, since I accidentally deleted all of the react and vite files. I had to install React and Vite again and the follow the steps accordingly. Meanwhile, the code was easy to do.
